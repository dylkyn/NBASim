# Team Final Project

### ECE4122\6122 Project Name: NBA Season Simulator
### Team Member(s): Dylan Kynoch, Justin Lau, Bella Poage, Christopher Burgett

##### Project Statement of Work:
Our plan is to create a fictional NBA Season Simulator Application. We will have a general league that consists of 32 custom teams each with 5 players.
Each player will have certain attributes and tendencies that will determine game possession outcomes.
For example, a dunk attempt (close range attribute) from an offensive player on a defensive player (block attribute) is determined by a random number generator to determine whether the attempt was successful (dunked) or not (blocked).
Each team has 103 possessions for each game in the bracket and each possession undergoes a simulation of defense and offense, taking things like blocking and 2-point shooting ability among other attributes. We use multithreading to optimize our simulations and speed up the program overall, and use SFML to create the graphics, which will display each games progress in the brackets.

##### All team members:
- Expected to contribute time and effort into making the project successful. This entails meeting coding, debugging, and communication requirements in a timely manner.
- Do necessary/required research into coding implementations.
- Help one another if bugs or problems in the project arise.
